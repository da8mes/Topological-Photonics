# Topological-Photonics
Work I am doing while at Simon Labs@UChicago with Professor Jon Simon and Logan Clark (PhD).

Contents:
A simplified model to characterize essential physics of our quantum optics experiment 

Simulations of model using Python, QuTip, Numpy, Scipy, and Jupyter Notebook 

Optimized simulations that include multi-body interactions and self-organization of light in Rydberg atoms
